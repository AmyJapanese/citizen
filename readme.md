# Citizen Syntax for VS Code

A minimal syntax highlighting theme for Visual Studio Code, inspired by the
MediaWiki **Citizen** skin.

## Philosophy

The Citizen skin intentionally minimizes syntax highlighting.
Its goal is readability for readers, not visual richness.

This theme follows the same philosophy:
- Few colors
- Low saturation
- Semantic emphasis over decoration

Some elements are slightly adjusted to make the theme usable for editing,
while preserving Citizen’s minimal aesthetic.

## Color Source

All syntax colors are derived from the official MediaWiki Citizen palette,
which itself is based on Material Theme Palenight.

No custom colors were invented.

## Supported
- Light mode
- Dark mode

## Status
Experimental / personal use.
